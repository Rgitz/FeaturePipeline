# Code Re-usability through feature pipeline framework

A simple feature pipeline to enhance the code re-usability for data science projects.

Steps:

1. Define computation logics defined on series as transforms functions
2. Add these transformations in feature pipeline
3. Apply transformations to apply the transformations sequentially and get final feature table
